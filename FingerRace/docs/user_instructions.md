Bump Map User Instructions
==========================

Bump Map is a competitive game for two to four players. It's a race, and
hitting the target of your color gains you points. The object of the game
is to be the first to 20 points. But here's the catch:
every time you remove your finger from the screen, you lose a point. That
means you'll have to fight to stay touching the screen - even if it means
knocking your opponent's finger off!

To start, each player places one finger on their side of the screen. The game
will start automatically, and the targets will move. The color of a player's
target is determined by the color of the side of the screen they touched to
start. Each player, keeping their finger on the screen, slides to touch their
target. Once a player touches their target, it will move away again. The
little boxes in the corners of the screen indicate how many targets the player
has left. Players keep sliding to their targets until one wins.

Here are some ideas for interesting gameplay:

* Put the device on a flat surface
* One player holds the device in their free hand
* Play holding hands (voluntarily?)
* Play using only pinkies
* Is slapping allowed?
